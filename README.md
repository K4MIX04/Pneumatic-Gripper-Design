# Pneumatic Gripper Design (University Project)

This repository contains an academic project completed as part of my Automation and Robotics degree at AGH University of Science and Technology.

## Project Overview
The goal of the assignment was to design a functional pneumatic gripper capable of lifting a specific payload, starting from basic kinematic equations up to a complete 3D assembly and technical documentation.

### Key phases of the project:
* **Kinematic & Force Analysis:** Mathematical calculations and simulations (using SAM) to determine the required gripping forces and stroke lengths.
* **Component Selection:** Sizing and selecting an appropriate pneumatic cylinder from the industrial **Festo** catalog.
* **CAD Modeling & FEA:** 3D parametric modeling and stress analysis (von Mises) performed in **Autodesk Inventor** to verify structural integrity.
* **Technical Documentation:** Creation of 2D assembly drawings and a complete Bill of Materials (BOM).
